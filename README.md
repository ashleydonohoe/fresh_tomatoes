# fresh_tomatoes

This is the first project for the Fullstack Nanodegree through Udacity. It uses a Python script that generates an HTML file for a website showing information, box art, and movie trailers for six movies.

Requirements:

Python 2.7

How to Use:

Use the command line to run entertainment_center.py with the following command:
  python entertainment_center.py
  
This creates an html file called fresh_tomatoes.html. Click on the movie art for any movie to see its trailer from YouTube.
